<h1>Coral Processor</h1>
<p>When running, this processor provides a simple web interface at the port specified in the processor properties (by
    default, port 18080). The home page of the UI provides access to the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
    <li>View Processor State</li>
    <li>Custom Routing of Outgoing FlowFile</li>
    <li>Accept Incoming FlowFile</li>
    <li>Create New FlowFile</li>
</ul>
<p>The intent of this processor is to provide a simple means to debug flow behavior at runtime, allowing for manual add,
    view, modify, and delete of individual FlowFiles in a running flow. It is not intended to run in a fully automated
    flow, but it can be useful during flow development to modify attributes or content, to route FlowFiles in a custom
    order.</p>

<h2>View Processor State</h2>
<p>FlowFiles are held in the context of the running processor. When the processor accepts an incoming FlowFile, it is
    removed from the NiFi data repositories.</p>
<p>When the processor is stopped, its running state is discarded, facilitating simple testing of flow functionality.</p>
<p>All FlowFiles held by the processor are viewable in the FlowFile table available in the "View Processor State" page.
    The following FlowFile aspects may be viewed from this table:</p>
<ul>
    <li>FlowFile Metadata (link) - view the FlowFile properties and attributes</li>
    <li>FlowFile Content (link) - view the raw FlowFile bytes</li>
    <li>FlowFile Creation Date</li>
    <li>FlowFile Attribute Count</li>
    <li>FlowFile Content Size</li>
</ul>
<p>From this view, the following actions may be performed on the FlowFile:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clone the FlowFile (create a copy of it)</li>
    <li>Drop the FlowFile (remove it from the state of the running processor)</li>
    <li>Route the FlowFile to the specified destination relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>The destination relationships may be dynamically defined via the processor property "Relationships".</p>

<h2>Accept Incoming FlowFile</h2>
<p>This processor may be used as the outgoing relationship destination of another processor. If so configured, it will
    accept FlowFiles for processing only upon manual intervention, via clicking the "Accept Incoming FlowFile" button on
    the processor home page.</p>
<p>The button increments an internal counter in the processor each time it is clicked. So, if
    three FlowFiles should be consumed by Coral from upstream processors, the button should be clicked three times.</p>
<p>Once added to the state of the running Coral processor, the FlowFile must be manually acted upon to remove it from
    the processor state. It may be cloned, dropped, or routed to any defined outgoing relationship, based on user
    action.</p>

<h2>Create New FlowFile</h2>
<p>This processor provides a simple interface to insert new FlowFiles into a running NiFi flow. Two modes are available
    to add new FlowFiles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>enter custom FlowFile text (useful for textual FlowFile content, such as JSON or XML)</li>
    <li>upload a custom FlowFile from a filesystem file (useful for binary FlowFile content, such as images or AVRO
        records)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Both the "FlowFile from text" and "FlowFile from file upload" web pages provide an interface to specify arbitrary
    FlowFile attributes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To add a new attribute, specify the attribute name and value, and click the "Add" button.</li>
    <li>To remove an existing attribute, specify the attribute name, and click the "Delete" button.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enter Custom FlowFile Text</h3>
<p>The FlowFile content may be specified by entering text in the "Content" text area on the page.</p>

<h3>Upload Custom FlowFile File</h3>
<p>The FlowFile content may be populated by uploading a file, using the "Choose File" button on the page. Once the file
    is selected, click the "Upload Content" button to populate the in progress FlowFile content.</p>

<h3>... Create New FlowFile</h3>
<p>Once the desired content and attributes are specified, the "Create FlowFile" button may be clicked to add the
    FlowFile to the processor state. To reset the content and attributes of the add screen, the "Reset FlowFile" button
    may be clicked. The reset action only affects the editing state of the in progress FlowFile.</p>
